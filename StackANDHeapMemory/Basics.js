// STACK MEMORY :
let name = "karan"
let anothername = name; 


anothername = "karan joshi"
console.log(name);
console.log(anothername);  
// THE VALUE DID'NT CHANGE IN THE NAME VARIBLE BECAUSE IT IS IN THE STACK MEMORY IN WHICH IT PASSES THE COPY OF THE VARIABLE AND DID'NT CHANGE ON THE ORIGINAL VALUE ...


// HEAP MEMORY :
let userone = {
    email:"karan@13",
    upi : "user@abyl"
}

let usertwo = userone
usertwo.email = "karanjoshi@123" ;

console.log(userone);
console.log(usertwo);
    // THE VALUE IS CHANGED IN THE BOTH THE EMAIL'S BECAUSE IN THE HEAP MEMORY THE USERTWO WILL GET THE REFERNCE VALUE OF THE USERONE NOT THE COPIED VALUE ..
